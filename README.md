# 🌱 Simhastha 2028 Clean & Green

Bin2Win is an innovative smart waste management system designed to tackle the massive waste challenges faced during large-scale events like cultural festivals, fairs, and religious gatherings. Instead of treating waste as an unavoidable problem, Bin2Win transforms disposal into a rewarding and engaging experience, motivating people to actively participate in keeping their surroundings clean.

In simple words: You throw waste → You earn Green Credits → You redeem rewards. This creates a fun, sustainable cycle of responsibility and reward.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Encourage people to throw waste properly at collection booths
- Earn Green Credit points → redeem eco-friendly gifts (coconut, flowers, prasad)
- Reduce litter, involve devotees, and keep the event eco-friendly & safe

## 💡 Concept Flow

**Devotee ➝ Booth ➝ QR Scan ➝ Points ➝ Gifts ➝ Recycling**

***Core Problem Addressed:***

Public events often generate huge amounts of unmanaged waste (plastic, food waste, wrappers, etc.), overwhelming cleaning staff and creating unhygienic conditions. For example, the 2019 Kumbh Mela produced over 30,000 tons of waste. Traditional systems fail due to:

Limited staff and infrastructure.
Lack of active public participation.
Inefficient recycling practices.
Bin2Win directly addresses these by incentivizing cleanliness, improving waste segregation, and ensuring proper recycling.
